This page presents one of the two exams from this course.

Take Home Exam 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/takehome_2))

Instructor's Notes: Problem 1 is somewhat similar to the last homework with an extention into Ekman transport -- **Use the notes** and your brain. Problem 2 should be straight forward, and is more report-like. Each of these problems is 50% of exam grade (out of 100 points). "Problem 3" is just for fun and will not be graded.
